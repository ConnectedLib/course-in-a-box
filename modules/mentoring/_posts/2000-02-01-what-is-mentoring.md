> A mentor is a person or friend who guides a less experienced person by building trust and modeling positive behaviors. An effective mentor understands that his or her role is to be dependable, engaged, authentic, and tuned into the needs of the mentee.<br/><br/>-- [Oregon Youth Challenge Program Mentor Training](https://www.oycp.com/MentorTraining/3/m3.html)

Mentoring is a supportive learning relationship.

Informal mentoring relationships often start out as simple friendships, and mentoring happens without structure or oversight. Informal mentoring can also occur when someone independently choses a mentor because they trust them and seek their expertise and advice.

Formal mentoring relationships can be established through organizations and come with formal training and expectations. These mentorship programs may require a time commitment, learning objectives, and key activities, and typically include regular meetings over a set period of time. 

Although mentors who work with libraries are often volunteers from the community, the role and responsibilities of a mentor go beyond that of a generic “volunteer” position. Successful mentoring experiences are usually mutually beneficial. Mentors may be motivated to develop leadership skills and to share their knowledge, while mentees may benefit from the support, inspiration, and agency they receive.
