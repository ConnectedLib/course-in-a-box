Now that you’ve read through the information on community-centered library services it’s time to get started trying it for yourself. Use the [_ConnectedLib Mentoring Workbook_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MN0NPnxHub2tFqB4HR8EkBLgRkUU6Y-pYUmuyCF6fe0/edit#){:target="_blank"} to keep on track.

Before moving forward in the module, spend some time thinking about what you already know about mentoring, and what you hope to learn from this module.

First describe your experience (if any) with mentoring. Then make a list of things you already **know** about mentoring. Then write down what you **want to learn** in this module. You’ll fill out the last column, what you learned (L), when you have completed this module.
