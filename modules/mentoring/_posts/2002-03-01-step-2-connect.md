## Finding Mentors

Some communities have youth-serving organizations, or even coalitions of organizations, that can provide or help identify potential mentors. Some national organizations that can help identify adult mentors and volunteers include:

You will want to collect some information about potential mentors to evaluate their potential as a mentor and aid in matching them to a youth participant later on. Make sure you share your goals and policies, so they know what they may be signing up for. Some of the things you may wish to ask for include: 

* Name, pronouns, and contact information
* Areas of interest or expertise
* What mentoring means to them, and experience they have had with mentoring (or being mentored) in the past
* Commitment level (if you have shorter and longer term opportunities)
* Why do they want to become a mentor? What do they hope to gain from the experience?
* What challenges do they think they might face as a mentor?

The Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA) outlines some key competencies to look for in mentors, including:
* Interest in helping others learn, both in one-on-one and in small group situations
* Demonstrated commitment to lifelong learning
* Time commitment to participate in all aspects of the program

Talk to and observe your youth community and learn about their interests. Perhaps you can help introduce potential mentees to mentors who can help them reach their goals.

## Youth Signaling
Teens and tweens might not tell you that they are looking for support — they may not even recognize it themselves. The concept of “youth signaling” describes behaviors that may be signs of youths’ motivation to learn. These “signals” could include:

* Sharing accomplishments
* Reaching out for guidance
* Openly displaying expertise
* Actively networking
