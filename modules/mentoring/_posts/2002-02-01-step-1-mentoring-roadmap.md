title: Step 1 - Create your mentoring roadmap
---

It’s important to understand your community and begin developing your mentoring roadmap, or basic plan for how you will execute your program. Consult the Creating Community-Centered Services module to learn more.

## Start with the outcomes

> "We identified some of the businesses we worked with as partners and sent a survey about their participation with our program, and it became clear that we were weak on presenting goals for the partnership and clear communication.  These should be outlined." <br/><br/> -- Sonya Harsha

As with any program or service design process, it’s helpful to start with the outcomes you want to see at the conclusion. Ask yourself the following questions: 

* Why and how would a mentoring program be helpful to the community? To the youth? To the library? 
* What kinds of mentors do I want? What kind of youth participants? 
* What will the participants’ goals be, and what will they get out of the program? What about the mentor?

Having clearly expressed goals will also make it easier to recruit mentors for your program, particularly if you are working with other organizations or businesses to obtain mentors.

## Fill in the details

Once you have a good idea of your destination in the form of outcomes and goals, it’s time to start filling in practical details. 

* **Participants:** Think about the information needs of the youth communities who will participate in the program. Are there non-native speakers of English? Homeschoolers? Immigrant and refugee communities? Could they benefit from additional support outside of the mentoring program? 
* **Mentors:** What specific knowledge, skills, and competencies will your mentors need to have? Do you have access to mentors outside the library? Are you specifically interested in certain occupations, demographics, or backgrounds (e.g. mentors with similar backgrounds as the youth)? 
* **Program elements:** What will the format of the program be -- one-on-one meetings or group mentoring in a workshop setting? Will it be in-person, virtual, or a hybrid format? What organizations or community members will you be partnering with? 

With these questions answered, you can begin creating a timeline and schedule, developing a recruitment or marketing plan (including any materials, handouts, or brochures), outlining training or orientation sessions, and thinking about program evaluation.  

## Create program policies
> Libraries may not have the structural policies in place to host mentorship opportunities on their own. Smaller libraries don't always have robust policy manuals and may not have considered limitations of partnering youth and adult mentors (background checks, maximum time limits, off-site meetups, etc.). Looking into library volunteer policies is a critical step in determining how far a mentorship program can go. -- SE

The majority of public libraries in the U.S. have volunteer policies in place, which can be a good start for a mentoring program. However, the very personal nature of mentoring and developing trusting relationships with youth means that policies that go beyond the typical library volunteer agreement are needed in order to protect both the mentors and the mentees. 

> "Consult with your library administration about the current volunteer policy to see how the program will fit in. Will mentors need to meet certain criteria to work with you? Are background checks required?" - SE

### Do many public libraries have mentoring policies? 

Two ConnectedLib partners, SE and Sonya Harsha, undertook a small project to review some volunteer policies from public libraries and evaluate how effective they would be for a mentoring program. Here are some of their findings: 
* “Many of the principles that I am seeing in volunteer policies should also be applied to mentoring, but the mentor should be ready to invest themselves into the lives and learning of the young people that the programs are designed for.”
* “I definitely noticed a lack of detail in the smaller library volunteer policies. They didn't seem to have directives about what types of specific activities volunteers could engage in other than clerical, cleaning and "special events".”
* “Most libraries don’t seem to have an explicit section in their policy about working with minors, and I assume it is because they don’t consider it an option.” 
* “One library policy I found does go as far as asking if the applicant has been convicted of a crime, but doesn’t specify which duty that would disqualify them from undertaking.”
* “I’m noticing a lot of “special projects” or “special events” tasks listed when browsing policies, or often just applications. Not a lot of clear guidance about, specifically, adult to teen volunteers in library policy.”

### A Policy Framework

> “Policies, which often feel like a hindrance, can also be really helpful when embarking on new projects; they can also convince partners to join because you have clear guidelines and expectations. - Sara Evans

Your policy should address the following elements: 

* Who can participate in the Mentorship Program as a mentor? Anyone over 18? Is a background check required?
* What timeline does participation in the Mentorship Program have? What are the minimum levels of participation (e.g., number of meetings per week, number of hours per month, etc.)
* What parameters are set for Mentorship? Is it career-focused? Interest-based?
* Where do mentors and mentees meet? At the library? Off-site? Virtually? All of the above? 

If the library can provide clear instructions, timelines, and expectations backed up by policy, organizations and individuals may feel more comfortable making a commitment.

## Make a launch plan

Think about your matching process:

* How will mentors be recruited and matched? Are you looking for teens to be paired with others that share their lived experiences (similar background)?
* What type of on-boarding or training will mentors be offered?
* Is there any incentive/recognition for the mentors?

Make a plan for launching or promoting the mentoring opportunities or connecting with possible community partners and organizations. Craft a message and talking points to deliver and present to local organizations.
