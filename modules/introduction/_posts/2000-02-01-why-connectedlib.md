title: Why ConnectedLib?

The ConnectedLib Toolkit was created to equip public youth library staff with the knowledge and skills they need to create connected learning programs at their own libraries. The modules can be completed as standalone lessons in any order, but working through the entire suite of lessons in order may help you get the most out of them. As a whole, the toolkit is designed to walk you through the connected learning basics, help you learn how to work effectively with teens, how to strategize and plan to implement connected learning in your own library, and how to reach out and work with your community to create effective connected learning programs for your youth patrons.

## History of connected learning

In the first decade of the 21st century, many organizations, projects, and researchers contributed to the movement towards more social, participatory, and interest-driven learning that led to connected learning -- the MacArthur Foundation, the Digital Youth Network, the DML Research Hub, Howard Gardner, Henry Jenkins, Katie Salen, Bill Penuel, Nichole Pinkard, Joseph Kahne, and more. The framework itself was developed in the early 2010s by Mimi Ito and her colleagues after extensively researching and working with teens. Connected learning is now at the center of a vibrant community of researchers and practitioners centered around the Connected Learning Alliance.
