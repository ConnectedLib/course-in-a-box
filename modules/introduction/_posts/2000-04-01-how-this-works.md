The ConnectedLib Toolkit was designed to be as flexible as possible for use by a variety of learners with different levels of knowledge and different amounts of time to spend. You can work through each module in a linear fashion in the order suggested below, or you can pick and choose modules (or even sections of modules) based on your needs and interests. You can work through the toolkit content on your own, or form a virtual or in-person *learning circle* with colleagues. 

## Toolkit Content

### The Modules

### Experiencing the Entire Toolkit

### The Workbooks

Most modules are accompanied by a workbook that you can download or copy from Google Drive. You can print them and fill them out by hand, save them as Word Documents or PDF files on your own computer, or copy them into your own Google Drive so you can edit them online. To copy a file into your own Google Drive, follow these steps:

1. Open the workbook you want to copy in your browser.
2. In the menu, click File and then Make a copy.
3. Type a name and choose where to save it.
4. Click Ok.
