Public libraries are uniquely positioned to support civic engagement. They know their communities. They enjoy the trust of their communities. They are staffed by people who care about their communities. They bring people together from different walks of life. 

> “Their role in civic engagement can manifest itself in many ways, as passive as simply providing space, and as active as outwardly seeking participation among members of their communities. Many libraries have already taken an active role in the civic arena, such as programs that tackle challenging social issues or encourage youth to get involved in their communities. When they don’t take on a leading role themselves, public libraries can be willing partners in efforts to improve the quality of life in their communities”. <br/><br/>— [Public Libraries as Platforms for Civic Engagement, 2018](https://tascha.uw.edu/publications/public-libraries-as-platforms-for-civic-engagement/)

Libraries don’t necessarily need to be the leader of a civic engagement program. They can be a catalyst using their knowledge of the community to bring together stakeholders. They can be a partner, playing a supporting role in a program led by another organization (read more about creating partnerships in our [Community-Centered Services Module](/modules/community-centered/).
