title: Tools for Designing Civic Engagement Services
---

There is no one way to create a civic engagement service; After having identified the interests of your community and the change you’d like to create, 
there are a variety of tools that can be used to make that goal happen. Below are examples of tools used in libraries big and small around the country.

### Technology and Games As Tools for Civic Engagement

The power for anyone to produce content, spread the word and connect between communities through everyday technologies has opened the door for individuals 
engaging in civic engagement. Social media, podcasts, video, performance, online campaigns….the list goes on.


Some examples of these tools include:

* Creating a **podcast** (See example of central library of the [Dallas Public Library] (https://connectedlib.github.io/course-in-a-box//modules/civic-engagement/roles/))
* **Online campaigns** (think of the power of starting an awareness campaign with hashtags on different platforms, creating a site rallying people to your 
cause, etc.)
* Joining **national movements**, like [ZeroHour] (https://www.thisiszerohour.org/). 

A great example of technology use for civic and community engagement is happening in the **Chicago Public Library YouMedia Lab**,  
where youth are using media creation tools to create a change in their immediate community.

Alternatively, the **North Olympic Library System** decided to preserve their community’s history through videotaping 
its founders and members:

<div class="videotime">5:13</div></div>

Note that expensive equipment isn’t necessarily needed. Phones can be used for media production, editing, sharing.Try and think of the everyday technologies that you already use: how might they be able to assist in creating prolonged, community rooted initiatives? 

Games are also an incredible tool to learn about a topic that interests youth and the community at large, as well as teach members about varying topics. 
Some of these games include:

* [Democracy games](https://www.democracygame.org/){:target="_blank"} 
* [iCivic games](https://www.icivics.org/games){:target="_blank"}   
* Simulation games like the Sims or [iThrive games] ((https://ithrivegames.org/) can be used to help young residents of the community 
learn about community necessities, priority building and so on

## Example: Identity Construction Environments (ICE)
One technique that has been used in several communities and relates well to the concept mentioned above of “imagining in order to act,” is using 
computer games as simulators for a better community life, as well as a way to test out solutions and initiatives that may later translate to real life 
activities within your community.

### Arts As Tools For Civic Engagement

Art (digital, physical, or otherwise!) is a powerful medium for sparking the civic mind and engaging youth in your community.

Some examples include:
* Raising awareness by putting on a community play
* Building art to engage the local community, like the [TinyWPA project](http://www.tinywpa.org/){:target="_blank"} 
* Creating a mural together with youth organizations to raise awareness for issues within the community like the [Madison Public Library community] (https://www.madisonpubliclibrary.org/impact/bubbler-time-covid ){:target="_blank"}  
* Engaging the older community members through targeted programs like the Brooklyn Public Library did through their [services](https://www.bklynlibrary.org/outreach/older-adults/creative-aging){:target="_blank"}
