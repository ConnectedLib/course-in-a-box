title: Opportunity

> “A college degree has become a requirement for most good jobs but is no longer a guarantee of acquiring one.”<br/>— Mizuko Ito et al. in _Connected Learning: An Agenda for Research and Design_


Opportunity-oriented learning helps teens build skills for academic, economic, or civic success, performing better in school, preparing for a 21st century workplace, and connecting with their community. Connected learning emphasizes opportunity now, not just in the far-off, theoretical future of a post-school college or job market, and connected learning activities give teens the chance to see the benefits of their actions first-hand.

## What does opportunity-oriented learning look like?
* Teens are connected to mentors with professional experience
* Programs relate to civic, economic, or academic development
* Teens see immediate value in activities
* Activities result in items or performances teens can use to demonstrate their achievements to others including peers, family members, teachers, and potential employers
* Library staff or mentors help teens connect their interests to broader marketable skills
