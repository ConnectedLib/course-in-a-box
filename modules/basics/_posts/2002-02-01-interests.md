> "We need to help them [teens] explore possibilities for their passions and give them the tools necessary to explore those passions.” <br/>– Youth Services Coordinator at an Urban Midwest Library
 
Learning that is driven by teens’ interests better aligns with their personal motivations and goals, leading to deeper learning and higher achievement. This helps all youth dig into learning in ways that may not be possible in traditional education settings.

The teen years are a time for identity formation. Young people are becoming more independent of their caretakers and learning more about themselves and the world as they interact with people, culture, and society. Connected learning can help teens construct their identity as they pursue their passions and explore new interests.

## Interest-Based Learning

Think back to a time in your youth when an adult tried to get you to learn something you weren’t interested in. Then think of a time you were very interested in learning about something. How did those experiences differ? Here are a few questions to get you started:
* How much time did you spend learning about the topics?
* Do you still remember anything about the topics?
* How engaged were you with the topics—did you ask questions or do your own research?
* How did the adult (if any) in the situation interact with you?
