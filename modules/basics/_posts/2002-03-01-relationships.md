> “Watching the teens find each other and connect with each other and realize,’Oh, I’m not the only geek on the planet, and there are other people that are really into stuff in an intense way and that’s okay and we can celebrate it’… Our writing club did fairytale fanfiction all summer and it was awesome to see how they bonded and got more comfortable sharing their geek with each other… Connecting the teens to each other is [a] huge success.”<br/>– Head of Circulation & Young Adult Librarian at a Suburban Northeast Library

When learning is supported by relationships, teens aren’t just learning with each other -— they’re also learning from each other by sharing their ideas, providing constructive feedback, and collaborating on projects.

## What Does Learning Through Relationships Look Like?
* Teens have time and space to “just hang out”
* Teens collaborate, share projects and activities, and give constructive feedback to each other
* Programs incorporate elements of culture that are important to teens' communities
* Library staff  and/or mentors help teens build or join a community around their interests


## Peer Supported, Socially Connected

## Mentor Relationships

Mentors play a key role in supporting teen interests and helping teens to gain skills and knowledge.  This video of the late "Brother Mike" Hawkins talking about his role as a mentor, and how others have mentored him, illustrates why mentors are important for teens.

As a part of connected learning, library staff should strive to connect teens and their interests to community members and stakeholders who can bring their own passions and interests to teens in order to build knowledge and skills.   


What makes a good mentor? You may know community members who share passions and interests with teens, but merely sharing interests does not necessarily equate to successful mentorship. According to [Alyse Kalish](https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-to-find-qualities-good-mentor){:target="_blank"}, a good mentor must also be respectful and empathetic, with an eagerness to share their interests and the ability to give constructive feedback. 






Before connecting teens with mentors, consider carefully what makes a good mentor. (You may have contacts with community members who share passions and interests with teens, however those shared interests do not necessarily equate to successful mentorship.  You can learn more about what makes for a good mentor in this article from The Muse.   After reading the article participate in the activity on connecting local mentors to teen interests:

* Make a list of the people who you think share those interests and meet the qualities of what makes a good mentor.
* Look at the interests in which you do not know a possible mentor. Who do you know who could help you to make relevant connections? 
* How can your library help to build relationships between these mentors and teens in the community?
