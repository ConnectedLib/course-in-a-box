Connected learning is an educational framework that connects interests, relationships, and opportunities. This section provides an overview of the concept, including the equity agenda that drives the framework, and introduces ConnectedLib.

> “Connected learning is realized when a young person is able to pursue a personal interest or passion with the support of friends and caring adults, and is in turn able to link this learning and interest to academic achievement, career success or civic engagement.”<br/>
– Mimi Ito et al. in _Connected Learning: An Agenda for Research and Design_


Connected learning is an educational framework — an approach to creating learning experiences. Connected learning is driven by learners’ interests, supported by their relationships, and oriented towards academic, economic, or civic opportunity.

At the heart of connected learning is an “equity agenda” to help close the cultural and economic gaps that non-dominant youth face. By connecting teens’ interests and relationships with real-life opportunities, connected learning helps prepare youth for life after high school with 21st century skills and the development of emerging digital literacies.
