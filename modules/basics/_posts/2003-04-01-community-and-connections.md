title: Developing Community and Connections
---
 
 Connected learning helps teens build a network of connections and support by plugging into their community, which can be defined by geography, people, opportunity, interest, or all of these at the same time. Connected learning is a social activity, bringing people of different ages and backgrounds together around common interests and goals. Working with peers and mentors reinforces a teen’s learning, motivates them to participate, and helps them develop the “soft” skills they need to succeed in society. Additionally, as teen culture becomes more and more participatory, teens need 21st century skills to fully engage with society.

Connected learning emphasizes building community relationships. Relationships with community organizations, businesses, and formal and informal learning institutions can enhance a library's capacity to support learning needs of teens.
