Connected learning is an educational framework — an approach to creating learning experiences — that connects relationships, interests, and opportunities. Connected learning is driven by learners’ interests, supported by their relationships, and oriented towards academic, economic, or civic opportunities.

At the heart of connected learning is an “equity agenda” which helps to  close the cultural and economic gaps that non-dominant youth face. By connecting teens’ interests and relationships with real-life opportunities, connected learning helps prepare youth for life after high school with 21st century skills and the development of emerging digital literacies.

### Worksheet #1: Connected Learning K-W-L

Before moving forward in the module, spend some time thinking about what you already know about connected learning, and what you hope to learn from this module. The [first worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X5MxpToji6SQEN3-6uzvvkfjpQFvUhTbZB1cPTM6FwA/edit#heading=h.5pf3n53wqrjk){:target="_blank"} in your [_Connected Learning Basics Workbook_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X5MxpToji6SQEN3-6uzvvkfjpQFvUhTbZB1cPTM6FwA/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} is a "KWL" — that stands for Know, Want to learn, and Learned. 

First describe your experience (if any) with connected learning. Then make a list of things you already **know** about connected learning. Then write down what you **want to learn** in this module. You’ll fill out the last column, what you learned (L), when you have completed this module.
