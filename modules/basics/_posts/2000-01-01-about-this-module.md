Connected learning is an educational framework — an approach to creating learning experiences — that connects interests, relationships, and opportunities. It is driven by learners’ interests, supported by their relationships, and oriented towards academic, economic, or civic opportunity.

At the heart of connected learning is an “equity agenda” to help close the cultural and economic gaps that non-dominant youth face. By connecting teens’ interests and relationships with real-life opportunities, connected learning helps prepare youth for life after high school with 21st century skills and the development of emerging digital literacies.
