<!-- > “Connected learning is realized when a young person is able to pursue a personal interest or passion with the support of friends and caring adults, and is in turn able to link this learning and interest to academic achievement, career success or civic engagement.”<br/>
– Mimi Ito et al. in _Connected Learning: An Agenda for Research and Design_ -->

Connected learning is an educational framework — an approach to creating learning experiences — that connects interests, relationships, and opportunities. It is driven by learners’ interests, supported by their relationships, and oriented towards academic, economic, or civic opportunity.

At the heart of connected learning is an “equity agenda” which helps to  close the cultural and economic gaps that non-dominant youth face. By connecting teens’ interests and relationships with real-life opportunities, connected learning helps prepare youth for life after high school with 21st century skills and the development of emerging digital literacies.

### Try it Out: Connected Learning K-W-L

The first worksheet in your _Connected Learning Basics Workbook_ is a "KWL" — that stands for Know, Want to learn, and Learned. 

Before moving forward in the module, spend some time thinking about what you already know about connected learning, and what you hope to learn from this module. 

First describe your experience (if any) with connected learning. Then make a list of things you already **know** about connected learning. Then write down what you **want to learn** in this module. You’ll fill out the last column, what you learned (L), when you have completed this module.
