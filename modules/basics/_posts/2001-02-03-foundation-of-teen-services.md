title: The Foundation of Teen Services
---
 
Library staff often say, “I can’t get teens into the library or to come to my programs, even though I’ve asked what they would like to see at the library.  They still don’t participate in library activities.”  However, when connected learning is embedded into teen services, as the center of those services, not as an add-on, the focus becomes not on whether or not teens come into the library building, but instead on how library staff can work with community stakeholders to guarantee that teens have the support they need to succeed.  For example,  if library staff are aware that teens in the community are interested in activities related to the environment, a library connected learning approach to supporting that interest would:

* Focus on library staff learning about the opportunities in the community to help teens engage in environmental activities locally
* Working with those other organizations, teens,  and stakeholders to build environmental activities in which teens take part
* Leveraging library space and resources as needed to support those activities. 

The focus then is not on teens in the building, but teens gaining a variety of skills, in and with the community, with support from the library.

When implementing connected learning as the foundation of teen services, library staff aren’t sponsoring programs and services that are not connected learning-centered. When connected learning is integrated into the foundation of a library’s teen services, all programs and services adopt connected learning principles. Libraries They do not, for example, host a teen advisory group and also a connected learning program. Instead, the library  plans and implements all teen services and programs (including teen advisory groups) any teen program or service, including teen advisory groups, are planned and implemented by embedding the core ideas of connected learning.  

You can get started thinking about how to truly make connected learning the foundation of teen services by developing a vision for your library’s teen services.  A vision is a short statement about what the library’s impact will be. Examples from the corporate world are:  Habitat for Humanity: “A world where everyone has a decent place to live.” Or, Teach for America: “One day, all children in this nation will have the opportunity to attain an excellent education.” The Tehama County Library in CA has this vision, “A community where learning, imagination, and opportunity thrive.” As you think about teen services, focus on the teens and the community instead of the library, what would your vision be? It might be something like, “Where teens find possibilities,” or “Guaranteeing teens succeed,” or “Building community through learning, creating, and opportunity.”

Before learning more about connected learning and having opportunities to consider how to make it the foundation of all of your teen services, draft a vision for your library’s teen services.  As you write about your vision, think not about what the library gets by building connected learning-based teen services, focus instead on what the benefit(s) are to teens and the community. :

## Why is this your vision?

As you continue with the materials in this module, return to your vision and make any changes that you think help your library create a foundation of CL for all teen programs and services.
