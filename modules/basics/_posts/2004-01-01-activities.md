### Worksheet #7: Putting Connected Learning into Context for Your Library

If you complete additional ConnectedLib modules, you may make modifications to this document as you learn more. Feel free to adjust the wording and the structure of the worksheet to fit the particular circumstances of your library.

<!-- Note: the term “youth services” and “youth services department” are used throughout this section. Your department may have a different name, or your library may have no youth services department at all, and you are simply “the one who works with kids.” Whatever the situation, feel free to adjust the wording and the structure of the worksheet to fit your particular circumstances. -->

## Your Library 

You will need your manager’s and director’s buy-in to allow you to take the time and effort to implement connected learning programs, so start by thinking about your library’s mission and strategic goals. Your library probably has a strategic planning document that describes a vision or mission. If not, try to have a conversation with the director and/or supervisor about their ideas and vision, or try to articulate this yourself based on what has been said and done in the past. Even if you do have a document to reference, you may still wish to have a conversation with one or both of them to fully understand their vision.

## Your Goals

Now formulate some connected learning goals, whether for yourself and your own professional development, your department, or your library, taking into account the strengths and weaknesses from the last step. Start with a small goal you can achieve within a month, then work up to longer-term goals. Include concrete steps you can take towards your goals.
