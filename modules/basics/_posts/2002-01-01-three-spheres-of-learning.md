> “Connected learning is realized when a young person is able to pursue a personal interest or passion with the support of friends and caring adults, and is in turn able to link this learning and interest to academic achievement, career success or civic engagement.”<br/>
– Mimi Ito et al. in _Connected Learning: An Agenda for Research and Design_ 

Teens’ learning occurs primarily in three different contexts, or spheres: their relationships, their unique personal interests, and their academic, work, or community settings. When the spheres are connected, teens’ quality of learning and engagement with learning increases.

<table class="colorful">
	<tr><th bgcolor="teal">Relationships</th><td>Teens learning with and from other teens as well as adults</td></tr>
	<tr><th bgcolor="purple">Interests</th><td>Offerings are aligned with teens’ goals and motivations</td></tr>
	<tr><th bgcolor="skyblue">Opportunity</th><td>Directed towards academic, civic, or economic achievement</td></tr>
</table>

Learning that engages all of these spheres is learning teens want to do because it is aligned with their goals and benefits these important areas of their lives.

### Worksheet #3: Self-Assessment Activity

As you read about the three spheres of learning in this section — interests, opportunity, and relationships — think about your library’s teen services and programs. How is each sphere present in the youth experience? How well do they incorporate the spheres of connected learning? Use the worksheet to conduct your assessment.
