title: Three Spheres of Learning
tags: ['sectionHead']
---

Teens’ learning occurs primarily in three different contexts, or spheres: their relationships, their unique personal interests, and their academic, work, or community settings. When the spheres are connected, teens’ quality of learning and engagement with learning increases.

<table class="colorful">
	<tr><th>Relationships</th><td>Teens learning with and from other teens as well as adults</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Interests</th><td>Aligned with teens’ goals and motivations</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Opportunity</th><td>Directed towards academic, civic, or economic achievement</td></tr>
</table>

Learning that engages all of these spheres is learning teens want to do because it is aligned with their goals and benefits these important areas of their lives.
