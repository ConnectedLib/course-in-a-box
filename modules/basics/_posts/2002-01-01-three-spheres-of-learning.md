> “Connected learning is realized when a young person is able to pursue a personal interest or passion with the support of friends and caring adults, and is in turn able to link this learning and interest to academic achievement, career success or civic engagement.”<br/>
– Mimi Ito et al. in _Connected Learning: An Agenda for Research and Design_ 

Teens’ learning occurs primarily in three different contexts, or spheres: their relationships, their unique personal interests, and their academic, work, or community settings. When the spheres are connected, teens’ quality of learning and engagement with learning increases.

<table class="colorful" cellspacing="10">
	<tr><th bgcolor="#eb898b">Relationships</th><td>Teens build relationships by learning with and from other teens as well as adults</td></tr>
	<tr><th bgcolor="#93913c">Interests</th><td>Learning opportunities are aligned with teens’ goals and motivations</td></tr>
	<tr><th bgcolor="#c7e8e2">Opportunity</th><td>Building skills directed towards academic, civic, or economic achievement</td></tr>
</table>

Learning that engages all of these spheres is learning teens want to do because it is aligned with their goals and benefits these important areas of their lives.
