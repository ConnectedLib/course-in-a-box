title: Three Spheres of Learning
tags: ['sectionHead']
---

Teens’ learning occurs primarily in three different contexts, or spheres: their relationships, their unique personal interests, and their academic, work, or community settings.1 When the spheres are connected, teens’ quality of learning and engagement with learning increases.

* Relationships: Teens learning with and from other teens as well as adults
* Interests: Aligned with teens’ goals and motivations
* Opportunity: Directed towards academic, civic, or economic achievement

Learning that engages all of these spheres is learning teens want to do because it is aligned with their goals and benefits these important areas of their lives.
