## Build Your Own Logic Model
Use our logic model template to get started building your own logic model:


Start with the outcomes. Outcomes are the changes in behavior, skills, attitudes, knowledge, etc. that you would like youth to gain through the program or service you develop.  Outcomes are not the activities you will do. They are what you want to achieve. 

Based on what you’ve learned with your community stakeholders, ask yourself, what you learned through those conversations and what you would like to work towards, with stakeholders to support youth learning and development. What you are working to achieve is your outcome. For example, if you’ve determined that one of the areas to work towards with stakeholders is to help build teen confidence, then that can be turned into an outcome. The outcome may be something like, “Teens demonstrate confidence.”
Next consider the resources you have for teen programs and services.  Who are the community stakeholders you have relationships with and who might be able to help you in support of building teen confidence? What space is available that you can use to work towards this goal? Is there space at the library or at a community site or in multiple locations? What money is available? Do you have a budget for this work and/or does your community stakeholder partner(s) have funds?  What about staff and volunteers, who is available to help in this work? 
Once you have an idea of the outcome(s) and the resources, consider the activities you might implement in order to provide programs and services for teens that help build confidence.  Remember you shouldn’t be doing this alone and will want to think about ways to design activities with stakeholders and teens (see the participatory design section below to learn how to do that)  The activities you ultimately move forward with should all be centered on the outcome related to confidence. As you develop the activities you will want to make sure that everything you put in place is working towards that outcome and you will be able to see demonstration that that was reached.
Once you have the activities in place, think about what you will create through those activities? These are the outputs. Often you can quantify the outcomes with the number of programs you’ll host, the number of lesson plans you’ll create, and so on. Again, these outputs should be focused on what is required to create that supports teens demonstrating confidence.

Using Your Logic Model
Once you have a logic model in place you will have a roadmap for the service you will develop.

## Planning and Co-Facilitating a Participatory Design Session
It’s your turn to try your hand at planning and co-facilitating a participatory design session.  
Start by connecting with stakeholders, colleagues, and teens  that you would like to join you in the process.  Consider who you have relationships with already, who helped you to determine your outcomes, and who you know is working towards goals that are mutual to yours.
Work with your co-facilitator(s) on coming up with a design goal - this should relate to your outcome(s) if you have developed those.  Work your way through the participatory design session template.
Once you have your template filled out, try your hand at co-facilitating the participatory design session.
Debrief with your co-facilitator(s). Consider what you thought went well, what was difficult, how your session helped you to understand what might be put into place to reach your outcome, what you would like to do next in a participatory design session, and so on.
Repeat the process until you have the information you need to build a program or service for and with teens and stakeholders to reach your desired outcome(s).  
Return to your logic model to add the activities you determined through the participatory design process.
