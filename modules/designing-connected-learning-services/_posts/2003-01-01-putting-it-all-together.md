## Planning and Co-Facilitating a Participatory Design Session

Itâ€™s your turn to try your hand at planning and co-facilitating a participatory design session.  

Start by connecting with stakeholders, colleagues, and teens that you would like to join you in the process.  Consider who you have relationships with already, who helped you to determine your outcomes, and who you know is working towards goals that are mutual to yours.
Work with your co-facilitator(s) on coming up with a design goal - this should relate to your outcome(s) if you have developed those.  Work your way through the [participatory design session template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YAb1uXwSoK8qw6uOts8wmM4BIYRPEoYPIoDw-YpPf7c/edit){:target="_blank"} designed by Beth Bonsignore, Linda Braun, and Mega Subramaniam at the University of Maryland.

Once you have your template filled out, try your hand at co-facilitating the participatory design session.

Afterwards, debrief with your co-facilitator(s). Consider what you thought went well, what was difficult, how your session helped you to understand what might be put into place to reach your outcome, what you would like to do next in a participatory design session, and so on.

Repeat the process until you have the information you need to build a program or service for and with teens and stakeholders to reach your desired outcome(s).  

Return to your logic model to add the activities you determined through the participatory design process.
