## Planning and Co-Facilitating a Participatory Design Session

It’s your turn to try your hand at planning and co-facilitating a participatory design session.  

Start by connecting with stakeholders, colleagues, and teens that you would like to join you in the process.  Consider who you have relationships with already, who helped you to determine your outcomes, and who you know is working towards goals that are mutual to yours.
Work with your co-facilitator(s) on coming up with a design goal - this should relate to your outcome(s) if you have developed those.  
Use [Worksheet #6: Participatory Design Session Planning Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rK1CFq_WpT5k4oH4-jMYW4kXdKrzJfS_RlVND8S1Y6E/edit#heading=h.nak6vkeg1hyb){:target="_blank"} to plan a design session. Once you have your template filled out, try your hand at co-facilitating the participatory design session.

Afterwards, debrief with your co-facilitator(s), using [Worksheet #7: Design Session Debriefing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rK1CFq_WpT5k4oH4-jMYW4kXdKrzJfS_RlVND8S1Y6E/edit#heading=h.lxawoj96jpta){:target="_blank"}. 

Repeat the process until you have the information you need to build a program or service for and with teens and stakeholders to reach your desired outcome(s).  Return to your logic model to add the activities you determined through the participatory design process.

### [Back to Worksheet #1: Designing Connected Learning Services K-W-L](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rK1CFq_WpT5k4oH4-jMYW4kXdKrzJfS_RlVND8S1Y6E/edit#heading=h.5pf3n53wqrjk){:target="_blank"}
It’s time to revisit Worksheet #1, the Designing Connected Learning Services K-W-L, and complete the “L” column. What have you _learned_ during this module? Did you learn everything from your “Want to Know” column?
