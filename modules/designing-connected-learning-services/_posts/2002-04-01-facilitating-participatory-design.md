title: Facilitating Participatory Design
---

It’s always a good idea to work with at least one other person - and probably not more than two other people - as you move through the participatory design process.  This includes working on the design goal and planning and facilitating the participatory design sessions. Working with others helps to better plan and debrief sessions as well as gain understanding of the learning that takes place during sessions.

You can read more about participatory design and techniques in the article [Designing the Library of the Future for and with Teens: Librarians as the “Connector” in Connected Learning](https://www.yalsa.ala.org/jrlya/2016/06/designing-the-library-of-the-future-for-and-with-teens-librarians-as-the-connector-in-connected-learning/){:target="_blank"} and via the Google Doc, [Implementing Participatory Design: A Few Resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wzohRl2wQ8S6mt2tUjgUmoK7jXBCyD9Xzg4atKMkGFk/edit){:target="_blank"}.

The below sample outcome of a participatory design session, co-facilitated by Austin Public Library youth staff and public school teachers, demonstrates how through the process, co-designers were able to plan how to support the needs of youth and families who participated in school virtually.  The public library staff used the ideas generated from the co-design sessions to begin planning for the fall 2020 school year. At the end of the co-design sessions, library staff asked for community direction on how they would like the library to stay accountable to them. The group of teachers preferred a newsletter, while some of the other groups requested a living dashboard that would be updated periodically. (See the [Austin dashboard](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b8ZuHzhcDkAM7p06xO3uyiShDJh48xrnEIci4SdNn1s/edit){:target="_blank"} developed through this work.) 


## Participatory Design Tips

- You do not have to, or want to, facilitate participatory design sessions on your own.  The planning, implementation, and debriefing of these sessions is a great way to build relationships with stakeholders, colleagues, and teens. **Work with at least one other person** - you probably don't want to work with more than three people all together - to co-facilitate the participatory design process.
- Remember that a key component of participatory design is that you don’t know exactly what you will learn and how activities will actually “go.”  Your planning has to allow for **flexibility and agility**.  While you must have a plan in mind, being able to shift as you see how things are unfolding is essential.
- **Openness to ambiguity** is essential.  As participatory design is about learning with others so as to be able to develop solutions related to your design goal. You won’t know what you will learn and/or come up with until the process is complete.
- **Debriefing** participatory design sessions is also essential. You and the others you are working with need to spend time talking about how the session went, what you learned, and how the session informs what you will do next.
