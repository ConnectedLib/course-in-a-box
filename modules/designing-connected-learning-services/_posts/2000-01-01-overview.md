### You Have What You Need

The modules in this Toolkit provide you with pieces of a framework for designing Connected Learning teen services.  This framework includes:

- Knowing the outcomes you would like to work towards
- Recognition of the assets in your community
- Building and/or having in place community relationships
- Learning through a participatory design process

While you might not have all of the pieces of the framework in place as you start designing your connected learning services planning process, starting with outcomes is essential to develop services that will have a positive impact on teens and the community at large.

### [Worksheet #1: Designing Connected Learning Services K-W-L](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rK1CFq_WpT5k4oH4-jMYW4kXdKrzJfS_RlVND8S1Y6E/edit#heading=h.5pf3n53wqrjk){:target="_blank"}

Before moving forward in the module, spend some time thinking about what you already know about designing connected learning services, and what you hope to learn from this module. The [first worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rK1CFq_WpT5k4oH4-jMYW4kXdKrzJfS_RlVND8S1Y6E/edit#heading=h.5pf3n53wqrjk){:target="_blank"} in your [_Designing Connected Learning Services Workbook_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rK1CFq_WpT5k4oH4-jMYW4kXdKrzJfS_RlVND8S1Y6E/edit?usp=sharing
){:target="_blank"} is a "KWL" — that stands for Know, Want to learn, and Learned.

First describe your experience (if any) with designing connected learning services. Then make a list of things you already **know** about designing connected learning services. Then write down what you **want to learn** in this module. You’ll fill out the last column, what you learned (L), when you have completed this module.
