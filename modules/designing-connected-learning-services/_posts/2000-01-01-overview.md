Connected learning directly supports library staff’s role as public servants. As described in [_Library Staff as Public Servants_](https://yxlab.ischool.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Field-Guide-2021-Final.pdf){:target="_blank"}, in the role of public servant library staff:

<div class="colorhighlight color1" markdown="1">
- Focus on community needs and assets rather than library interests or what they think communities need. 
- Focus on solutions and not problems by resisting the temptation to get stuck in challenges, instead consider how solutions can be co-created with the community to result in measurable outcomes.
- Realize that equitable services go beyond access to physical materials and the library building.
- Have flexible library policies and structures in place.
- Let go of legacy programs and services by reflecting on the programs and services they should keep, what they should leave behind, and what should be added.
</div>


Framing each of the above ideas within the context of connected learning:

<div class="colorhighlight color2" markdown="1">
- Focusing on community needs and assets over library interests requires building relationships with community stakeholders, including teens, and results in the ability to leverage those relationships to support teen interests and opportunities.
- Looking at solutions over problems means that library staff have the chance to focus on outcomes - what needs to be achieved with the community - and through that focus determine what are the most effective methods to achieve those.
- Valuing what truly equitable services look like requires library staff to connect with and support voices that are not regularly heard. As a result youth and community stakeholders have new and expanded opportunities to build relationships, explore their interests, and connect to opportunities.
- When libraries have flexible policies and structures, barriers that can exist to connected learning services - such as staffing models and on-desk requirements - enable library staff to connect with community stakeholders, including teens, at times and locations that reflect how the community works, not how the library works.
- Moving away from how things have always been done to respond to the strengths and challenges of the local community enables library staff to build new relationships, explore changing and varied community interests - particularly with community members whose voices are not regularly heard - and investigate and build opportunities for and with teens.

This section of the ConnectedLib Toolkit builds off of the ideas of Library Staff as Public Servants and provides a framework for designing, with community stakeholders, including teens, connected learning services for your specific community. It incorporates ideas in previous sections of this Toolkit including:
- Knowing your outcomes and working to achieve those through connected learning services
- Recognizing and leveraging your specific communities’ assets
- Building and expanding community relationships
- Using a participatory design process to develop services that are just right for the community you work with and for

As you design connected learning services you will gain a better understanding of your community, work towards valuable outcomes, and ultimately create impact for and with teens and the community at large.
