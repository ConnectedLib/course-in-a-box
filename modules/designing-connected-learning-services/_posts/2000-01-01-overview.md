### You Have What You Need

The modules in this Toolkit provide you with pieces of a framework for designing Connected Learning teen services.  This framework includes:

- Knowing the outcomes you would like to work towards
- Recognition of the assets in your community
- Building and/or having in place community relationships
- Learning through a participatory design process

While you might not have all of the pieces of the framework in place as you start designing your connected learning services planning process, starting with outcomes is essential to develop services that will have a positive impact on teens and the community at large.
