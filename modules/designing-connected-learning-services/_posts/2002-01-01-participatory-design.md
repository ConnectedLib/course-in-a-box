Once you have your logic model outcomes and resources in place - which you have determined community stakeholders, including teens - it can be beneficial to use a participatory design process to determine activities and outputs.  In this section of the module weâ€™ll provide an overview of participatory design and ideas on how you can get started integrating the technique into your connected learning work. The terms participatory design and co-design are often used interchangeably. Through participatory design, co-designers learn together and work towards solutions to a common design goal.

The overarching principles of participatory design are<sup>1</sup>:
- All co-designers are equal partners
- Every opinion is valid and of equal importance
- Design takes place without constraints
- There are no preconceived notions

Within those co-design principles, the following elements are critical:
- **Relationships**: centered on trust and power sharing 
- **Flexibility and agility**: centered on scaffolding learning, risk taking and failure
- **Teamwork**: centered on embracing different perspectives and varying levels of expertise
- **Openness to learning**: centered on co-learning, new ideas, and not being an expert

We are using participatory design in this module as it is a highly customizable approach for learning with and from community members - including teens - and building programs and services based on that learning.
