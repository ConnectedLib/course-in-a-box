title: The SEL Settings
---

The SEL "settings" are four different environments where youth learn social and emotional skills (the settings are similar to [Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems](2002-05-01-Bronfenbrenners-Ecological-Model)). When the settings are partnered and aligned, youths’ SEL is even greater.

<table class="updatedcolor">
	<tr><th bgcolor="#85c0fe">Classrooms</th><td>Classrooms can foster SEL through explicit instruction and curriculum, but also by fostering a classroom climate that models and scaffolds the five competencies. Although classrooms are formal learning environments, some of the ways they can support SEL are relevant to learning that is sponsored by or takes place in the library, or any learning that involves interaction with library staff.
</td></tr>

<tr><th bgcolor="lightpink">Schools</th><td>Schools support SEL by implementing policies and practices that encourage and provide resources for SEL, and providing opportunities for SEL outside of the direct classroom learning experience. Similarly, library management and administration should be key supporters of teen services’ efforts. 
	</td></tr>
	<tr><th bgcolor="#fffd86">Families & Caregivers</th><td>Families and caregivers are typically the biggest influence on youths’ SEL. CASEL emphasizes that families and caregivers are important stakeholders in a school’s SEL efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><th bgcolor="#85c0fe">Communities</th><td>Community organizations and other community partners should communicate with schools and with each other and align their efforts to have the greatest impact on youth.

## [Worksheet #3: The CASEL Settings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PZJ_VmpqentsoFv__xt5jRH5g8Ta0u4-2i3XAW4HuKU/edit#heading=h.q0jrmlw992w9){:target="_blank"}

Explore [CASEL's Interactive Wheel](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/#interactive-casel-wheel){:target="_blank"}, then answer the following questions. 

* What is the library’s place in the four outer rings that form the “settings” part of the wheel? 
* Are there any ways you can apply the information about “classrooms” to the library? 
* Which of the competencies do you see as strongest in the teens of your community? How could the library help them strengthen the competencies that are less developed?
