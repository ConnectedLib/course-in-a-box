title: The SEL Settings
---

The SEL "settings" are, similar to Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems, four different environments where youth learn social and emotional skills. When the settings are partnered and aligned, the youths’ SEL is even greater.

<table class="updatedcolor">
	<tr><th bgcolor="#85c0fe">Classrooms</th><td>Classrooms can foster SEL through explicit instruction and curriculum, but also by fostering a classroom climate that models and scaffolds the five competencies. Although classrooms are formal learning environments, some of the ways they can support SEL are relevant to learning that is sponsored by or takes place in the library, or any learning that involves interaction with library staff.
</td></tr>

<tr><th bgcolor="lightpink">Schools</th><td>Schools support SEL by implementing policies and practices that encourage and provide resources for SEL, and providing opportunities for SEL outside of the direct classroom learning experience. Similarly, library management and administration should be key supporters of teen services’ efforts. 
	</td></tr>
	<tr><th bgcolor="#fffd86">Families & Caregivers</th><td>Families and caregivers are typically the biggest influence on youths’ SEL. CASEL emphasizes that families and caregivers are important stakeholders in a school’s SEL efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><th bgcolor="#85c0fe">Communities</th><td>Community organizations and other community partners should communicate with schools and with each other and align their efforts to have the greatest impact on youth.
