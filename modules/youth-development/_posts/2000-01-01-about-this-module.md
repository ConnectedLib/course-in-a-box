### [Worksheet #1: Youth Development K-W-L](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PZJ_VmpqentsoFv__xt5jRH5g8Ta0u4-2i3XAW4HuKU/edit#heading=h.5pf3n53wqrjk){:target="_blank"}

Spend some time thinking about what you already know about youth development, and what you hope to learn from this module. The [first worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PZJ_VmpqentsoFv__xt5jRH5g8Ta0u4-2i3XAW4HuKU/edit#heading=h.5pf3n53wqrjk){:target="_blank"} in your [_Youth Development Workbook_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PZJ_VmpqentsoFv__xt5jRH5g8Ta0u4-2i3XAW4HuKU/){:target="_blank"} is a "KWL" -- that stands for Know, Want to learn, and Learned. 

First, describe your experience (if any) with youth development. Then make a list of things you already **know** about youth development. Then write down what you **want to learn** in this module. You’ll fill out the last column, what you learned (L), when you have completed this module.
