## [Worksheet #4: Tying it All Together](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PZJ_VmpqentsoFv__xt5jRH5g8Ta0u4-2i3XAW4HuKU/edit#heading=h.nurzocswl387){:target="_blank"}

Choose one of the theories of youth development that we studied in this module (Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development, Vygotsky’s Sociocultural Learning Theory, and Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Model), one of the SEL competencies (self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, or responsible decision-making), and one of the connected spheres of learning (interests, relationships, and opportunity). Write or illustrate a short vignette showing how these three elements can relate to each other in your library context. The story could be based on something that has happened in your library, a program or service you would like to develop, or just an imaginary but plausible situation with the youth in your community.

Now that you've learned about theories of youth development and how they can apply in a library setting, return to the KWL (Know-Want to Know-Learned) worksheet you started at the beginning of the module and complete the final column with what you have learned.
