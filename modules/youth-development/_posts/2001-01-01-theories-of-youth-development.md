Youth development can be approached from many perspectives. In this section, you will be introduced to key theories of child development. In particular, we focus on:

* Piaget’s cognitive development theory: groundbreaking theory of cognitive development that included four distinct stages. Piaget theorized that people construct knowledge and meaning from their experiences of the world–a concept known as constructivism.
* Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory
* Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model of development

You can draw on these theoretical perspectives to guide the design of your youth-centered programming and services.

## Which Theory is Right?

There is no single theory that accounts for every aspect of youth learning and development. The theories described in the following sections have different strengths and weaknesses, and they can complement or build on each other. Each theory can teach us something different about supporting youth development through library programming.
