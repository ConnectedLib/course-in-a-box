---

The SEL framework is composed of five competencies (self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making) that youth develop across four settings (classrooms, schools, families and caregivers, and communities).

The competencies represent knowledge and skills in five different facets of social and emotional abilities. The table below defines each competency and describes some ways that library services and connected learning could support teens’ SEL. (The definitions are from [CASEL’s Interactive Wheel](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/#interactive-casel-wheel){:target="_blank"}.)

## Self-awareness

“The abilities to understand one’s own emotions, thoughts, and values and how they influence behavior across contexts.”

* Activities that encourage self-expression or help teens observe their own growth and learning
* Mentors and other adults that are open about their own feelings
* Support for teens pursuing interests that are or may become a part of their identity

* What is the library’s place in the “settings” part of the wheel? 
* Are there any ways you can apply the information about “classrooms” to the library? 
* Which of the competencies do you see as strongest in the teens of your community? How could the library help them strengthen the competencies that are less developed?
