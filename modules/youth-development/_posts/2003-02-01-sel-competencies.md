The competencies represent knowledge and skills in five different facets of social and emotional abilities. The table below defines each competency and describes some ways that library services and connected learning could support teens’ SEL. (The definitions are from [CASEL’s Interactive Wheel](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/#interactive-casel-wheel){:target="_blank"}.)
