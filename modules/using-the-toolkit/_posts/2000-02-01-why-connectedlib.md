> As social and technological hubs for their communities, libraries are natural
environments to connect learning, creativity, and knowledge production. They are
centers for knowledge creation and sharing, they support self-directed and interest-based
learning, and they are inclusive public spaces that bring many different groups together.<br/><br/>— [Connected Libraries: Surveying the Current Landscape and Charting a Path to the Future](https://connectedlib.ischool.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ConnectedLibraries-SurveyingtheCurrentLandscape-and-ChartingthePathtotheFuture.pdf){:target="_blank"}


The ConnectedLib Toolkit was created to fill the need for accessible professional educational resources for library staff who work with teens and wish to learn how connected learning can help their youth services have a greater impact for their community. Public libraries have a unique set of strengths and opportunities that are not found in formal learning environments, which makes connected learning materials designed for schools or other structured settings less relevant to libraries. The Toolkit was created with the input of over one hundred staff from libraries all over the United States.

## A short history of connected learning

In the first decade of the 21st century, many organizations, projects, and researchers contributed to a movement centered on social, participatory, and interest-driven learning that led to connected learning. Organizations including the [MacArthur Foundation](https://www.macfound.org/){:target=”_blank”}, the [Digital Youth Network](http://digitalyouthnetwork.org/){:target=”_blank”}, and the [Digital Media Learning (DML) Research Hub](https://dmlhub.net/){:target=”_blank”}, and individuals like Howard Gardner, Henry Jenkins, Katie Salen, Bill Penuel, Nichole Pinkard, Joseph Kahne, and many more all engaged in this movement. The connected learning framework itself was developed in the early 2010s by Mimi Ito and her colleagues after extensive research and engagement with teens. Since that time, a vibrant community of researchers and practitioners has formed with the Connected Learning Alliance as a central hub for ongoing learning and practice. .
