title: Backwards Design
---

“Backwards design” is an approach to developing learning experiences. Starting with the desired outcomes for your program and how you will measure them, the process works in an "backwards" direction, planning the specific activities involved in the program last.

When considering the CL services you are going to design with and for teens in your community, the backwards design process will start with the outcomes you built as a part of the outcomes and assessment module in this Toolkit.

## Start with Outcomes

Designing a program starts with a thoughtful articulation of the outcome or outcomes you want to achieve through it. An outcome is simply something outside of your program and outside of connected learning that matters to someone.

The outcomes you want from your programs should align with your library’s strategic mission as well as the goals and needs of your community. But the desired outcome for any particular program doesn’t haven’t to be a high impact achievement. You may simply want to help your teens become more comfortable visiting the library space, or encourage friendships to form. Ask yourself (and your stakeholders): “What will the participants think, do, or feel as a result of their experience?”

Talk to your stakeholders as you develop outcomes. They should all agree that the outcomes are important and desired. They may even suggest surprising or nontraditional outcomes. By involving your stakeholders, you can get different perspectives on what outcomes are the most important.

## Connected Learning Outcomes

In this section we will look at different kinds of outcomes you might consider for your program. YALSA has identified six categories of outcomes for its “Teens First” approach to programming: community, creativity, digital citizenship, leadership, learning, and literacies. (For a list of sample outcomes for each category, see [Teens First: Basic Learning Outcomes](http://www.ala.org/yalsa/sites/ala.org.yalsa/files/content/Teens%20First_%20Basic%20Learning%20Outcomes%20Guide.pdf){:target="_blank"}
 
**Community**-focused outcomes center around the teen engaging, connecting, and building relationships with their peers and with their broader community. So-called “soft skills” like collaboration and communication are critical for 21st century workplaces and will improve teens’ lives in general.2 Some of these skills can be developed by teens “just” hanging out at the library.

**Creativity** outcomes result in teens’ learning how to express themselves, innovate, and solve problems.

**Digital citizenship** means that teens are able to use technology responsibly, ethically, and safely.

An important part of connected learning is building the capacity for **learning** more in the future. These outcomes focus on building the skills needed to successfully pursue learning independently.

**Literacy** outcomes result in teens having the ability to use various tools and platforms to create content and express themselves.

## Other Categories

In addition to these categories of outcomes identified by YALSA, we found a few more themes in our interviews with library staff.

### 21st century skills
“21st century skills” is a broad term that describes a set of interrelated, transferable literacies and competencies that youth must develop “to succeed in college, career and life.”2 The National Research Council4 groups these skills into three major “domains of competence”: cognitive (including critical thinking, problem solving, and creativity), intrapersonal (involving self-regulation, conscientiousness, and intellectual openness), and interpersonal (involving communicating and working with others).

### Academic enhancement

Although connected learning is, by definition, not limited to the classroom, it can enhance knowledge of traditional academic subjects like math, science, history, and the arts. Library programming can help deepen students’ engagement with these topics or provide a new perspective.

### Safety and security

Libraries can provide physical and emotional security for vulnerable teens, as well as food security. Simply having a safe space to turn to can be a huge benefit to many teens who do not live in a safe neighborhood or who don’t have an ideal home life. Several youth librarians described their role as a non-teacher, non-parent adult that teens could turn to to discuss sensitive topics like gender identity and sexual orientation. Some libraries partner with local organizations to provide summer lunches or after-school snacks to combat hunger and its related performance and behavioral issues. Connected learning programs that celebrate teens’ interests and culture can help get at-risk teens into the supportive environment of the library.

> “I wouldn’t say that [playing board games at the library] is really achieving much besides they get to socialize in a safe space where no one’s yelling at them.”<br/><br/>— Young Adult Librarian at an urban northeastern library

### Exploring interests
Interest powered learning means creating programs around existing interests, but it can also mean helping teens explore new areas of learning and developing new interests. Adolescence is a time of exploration, and public libraries can provide low-commitment opportunities for teens to “mess around” with new subjects, technologies, and career options. These connections can be made in surprising ways. A teen services librarian from a suburban western library told us about a program involving the dismantling and then remixing of stuffed animals to create new hybrid species. What started as a “just for fun” program became a much deeper learning experience when a veterinarian joined in, demonstrated suturing techniques, and talked to the participants about being a vet, sparking their interest in both human and animal medicine and anatomy.

> “Teens especially encounter a lot of resistance from different areas of public life, and so I’m really dedicated to… wanting teens to feel comfortable enough to really explore and get messy with things and fail in their experiments and then build on that to succeed later.”<br/><br/>— Focus Group Participant

### Career readiness

Connected learning programs, being opportunity oriented, can help learners build technical skills that employers are looking for. Volunteer and intern programs give teens something to put on their resume before entering the post-high school job market, and demonstrate that they have the interpersonal skills needed to be productive employees.5 Librarians and mentors can help teens turn their creative output into digital portfolios, or learn how to translate their activities into skills on their resumes.
