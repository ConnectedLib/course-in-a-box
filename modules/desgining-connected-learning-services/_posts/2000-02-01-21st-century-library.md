title: The 21st Century Library
---

Connected learning is characterized by
- Teens learning through **relationships**, with other teens as well as adults
- Programs that are aligned with teens’ goals, motivations and **interests**
- Orientation towards academic, civic, or economic **opportunities**
- **Production centered** learning through creation
- Providing teens with guidance and resources, **building pathways** to success
- Instilling a sense of **shared purpose**
- **Sponsorship of teens’ interests**, validating them through mentorship and other support

Libraries have been undergoing transformation from passive archives of information to active community centers for learning and creation. In [The Future of Library Services For and With Teens: A Call to Action](http://www.ala.org/yaforum/future-library-services-and-teens-project-report){:target="_blank"}, the authors present a modern vision of teen library services that embrace diversity, build 21st century skills, and engage teens as active participants in their own learning. The 21st century library is no longer a “grocery store” of information, it is a “kitchen” full of tools and resources to help teens create new knowledge in the modern, digital-centric.

Connected learning, with its emphasis on creation and ownership, is well-suited for 21st century library teen services. [The Future of Library Services For and With Teens: A Call to Action](http://www.ala.org/yaforum/future-library-services-and-teens-project-report){:target="_blank"} outlines five issues that libraries face due to changing technology and demographics, four key things that teens need from libraries, along with several implications for library operations. These points are summarized in the box below, and you can use them as the basis for talking to your colleagues about why connected learning is important for your library.

## The Future of Library Services For and With Teens: A Call to Action

The following points are from the YALSA report, [The Future of Library Services For and With Teens: A Call to Action](http://www.ala.org/yaforum/future-library-services-and-teens-project-report){:target="_blank"}, by Linda Braun, Maurnee Hartman, Sandra Hughes-Hassell, Kafi Kumasi, and Beth Yoke.

Libraries are facing the following issues related to teens:

- Teens make up a significant portion of library users
- Library services and resources for teens are in jeopardy
- There has been a significant shift in the demographics of teens
- Technology continues to impact communication methods, learning, and teaching
- Teens are entering the workforce without critical skills

What teens need from libraries:
- Bridge the growing digital and knowledge divide
- Leverage teens’ motivation to learn
- Provide workforce development training
- Serve as the connector between teens and other community agencies

To learn more about these issues and needs, read the [full report](http://www.ala.org/yaforum/future-library-services-and-teens-project-report){:target="_blank"} or the [three-page executive summary](http://www.ala.org/yaforum/sites/ala.org.yaforum/files/content/YALSA_nationalforum_ExecutiveSummary_Final_web.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

How do your current teen offerings illustrate the principles of connected learning listed above? If they don’t, what are some ways you could integrate them into your existing programs? If you want, you can focus on a single program, project, or initiative. If you are not currently working in a library, choose a library you are familiar with and learn about their youth programs.

- Programs are aligned with teens’ goals, motivations and interests
- Teens learn through relationships, with other teens as well as adults
- Orientation towards academic, civic, or economic opportunities
- Production centered learning through creation
- Providing teens with guidance and a variety of resources to build pathways to success
