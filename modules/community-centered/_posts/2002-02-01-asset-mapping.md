title: Asset Mapping
---

Asset mapping is a systematic approach to getting to know the people, places, and resources that surround your library. It is a way to take stock of “the gifts, skills and capacities of individuals, voluntary associations, institutions, physical assets, local economy assets and stories in the community.” The community mapping process may draw on, among other sources of information,
* Interviews
* Surveys
* Focus groups
* Statistics about your community
* Business directories
* Driving or walking around

Learning more about all the people in your community (and not just those that already use the library) can help you
* Identify ways for the library to better meet the wants and needs of your community
* Find opportunities to reach new audiences
* Uncover groups that are not being reached by the library

Getting to know the associations, businesses, and other resources in your community can help you
* Find experts to mentor your teens or help with programs
* Discover physical resources you can leverage
* Understand what is available to your community from sources outside the library
* Identify or form relationships that can lead to partnerships

Driving or walking around as if you are new to the area can help you:
* Identify parts of the neighborhood or community that you currently take for granted or hadn’t even noticed
* Understand what is available to community members and how people spend their time.
* Recognize what business employ those who the library serves

Community mapping focuses on the strengths and assets of a community instead of on weaknesses and gaps, leading to unconventional programs that leverage a community’s unique strengths. 

Community asset maps take many forms, from simple lists that fit on a single piece of paper to extensive reports and geographic maps. Plotting the resources and groups you discover on a map of your city or neighborhood may be useful and can inspire you to form out-of-the-box connections, but many community maps are much more simple. Look at the following examples for inspiration.

* There is an example of a community asset map on page 38 of The Engaged Library: Chicago Stories of Community Building from the Urban Libraries Council.
* This map from Brighter Futures Together depicts assets of individuals alongside those of associations and organizations in the community.
* The UCLA Center for Health Policy Research locates assets on a geographic map.
