title: Talking with the Community
---

One powerful way to gather data about your community is to have conversations with those who live and work there.  You may start by connecting to people that you identified in the community mapping process and that also connect to the questions you would like to have answered through your data gathering process.  The goal of talking with those who live and work in the community is to have your questions answered. What you talk about should be focused on what you want to learn, not what you want people to know.  conversations may be

## Getting started with community-centered conversations

It may be difficult for you to engage in the conversations that are described here.  The tips below should help you get started:

* Ask a colleague to join you in the conversation.  Perhaps you know someone who is a friend or colleague of the person you would like to talk with. If that’s the case you can ask for your colleague to make the introductions and to join you in the conversation.
* Remember that friends and family may have information that can be useful in your data gathering.  Ask them who you might talk with to have your questions answered and to learn more. Ask them to make introductions where possible.  
* If you don’t have a connection to whom you would like to talk with, when you contact them for the first time, focus on building the relationship so as to better understand the community and teens in the community.  Point out how the conversation could be beneficial to both instead of focusing just on what the library will gain.
* Ask the person you would like to talk with to suggest dates and times for you to meet up.  That is a way to share power with the person and to acknowledge that their time is valuable.

If colleagues and administrators are not supportive of the conversations with community members, begin a conversation about what they would like to know about the community and how they would find out that information. Invite them to join you in the conversations or give you ideas of what to talk about.  Speak about the ways in which the conversations will better support the needs of teens which will ultimately lead to a thriving community.

## What should I ask? 

In a worksheet accompanying [_Library Staff as Public Servants_](https://yxlab.ischool.umd.edu/projects/reimagining-youth-services-during-crises/){:target="_blank"}, Mega Subramaniam and Linda Braun suggest the following questions you could ask your community contacts: 

* You interact with the community everyday, what are the problems you are hearing about at this very moment? 
* What interventions do you think will help solve that problem?
* Who is working with them to solve these problems, and how?
* How can we get to know more community connectors like you that can share community needs with me?
* What are you seeing as the primary needs of youth and families [or insert another community that you are interested in] in your area during this time?  
* Who in the community is working with the population of interest and what kinds of services are they providing?
* If I'd like to connect briefly with [community of interest], how should I go about it?

Remember that talking with community stakeholders may be  a first step to building the types of relationships that can lead to partnerships.  This means that you should keep in mind that the conversation has the potential to be more than a one and done experience.  After each of your conversations, consider opportunities to talk again with the person you connected with.  You may want to check-in about something you learned during your conversation or you may want to let them know how you are thinking about what you learned and ideas and knowledge you generated because of the conversation.   As you continue to talk and learn from each other you will gain insight into each other’s goals and start to generate ideas for partnering in support of those.

## Numbers to build community understanding

One more way in which to answer the questions you have about your community, is to gather numbers about those you serve. In [_Library Staff as Public Servants_](https://yxlab.ischool.umd.edu/projects/reimagining-youth-services-during-crises/){:target="_blank"}, Mega Subramaniam and Linda Braun share the following resources for data-gathering. 

### [Census Reporter](https://censusreporter.org/){:target="_blank"}

Using data gathered from the decennial United States Census, you can search by zip
code, state, location, or topic to find statistics on age, sexual identity, family
characteristics, employment status, languages spoken, poverty rates, income, marital
status, and more.

### [ESRI Tapestry](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/tapestry-segmentation/overview){:target="_blank"}

When you type in a zip code via ESRI Tapestry, you'll find out about the population
median age, median income, education attainment, workforce type, and more of the
area. ESRI uses segmentation and categorizes types of communities with labels such as
heartland communities, salt of the earth, metro renters, and urban chic.

### [KidsCount Data Center](https://datacenter.kidscount.org){:target="_blank"}

This dataset provides yearly updates of data related specifically to the health and well
being, education, safety, employment, and family life of children and families across the
United States.

### [National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)](https://nces.ed.gov/){:target="_blank"}

Searching by district, The Institute of Education Sciences provides yearly updated
information including school type, address, number of schools in a district, staff and
faculty statistics, grades serviced, and links to community demographics, population,
and median household income.

As you think about the different tools available, reflect on the questions you would like to have answered.  Consider which tool(s) will best help you to answer the questions.  Ask yourself if you would like to start with a larger context and then dig down into local data in order to put the local data into context.

Will you review numerical data, participate in asset mapping, have conversations with community members and stakeholders, all of these, or a couple of these?
