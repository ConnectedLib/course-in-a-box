title: Rethinking partnerships
---

Libraries can build partnerships in support of connected learning by starting to build relationships with people, organizations, and stakeholders that relate to the interests of teens.  You might get started by going to events in which teens are involved - school plays and sporting events for example - and talking with the adults at those events. If you attend meetings of organizations that support teens, talk with the people there about their connections to teens and  how they see teens being supported in the community.  Through these conversations and event/meeting attendance, library staff are able to learn about teen interests and begin to build relationships with others in the community who can through time and relationship-building can become partners in support of teen interests, building of relationships, and creating opportunities.

## The Value of Partnerships
Partners can help create connections between youth’s everyday learning environments (home, school, and library) and “real world” spaces, opening up a more diverse set of possible experiences and directions for learners.
* A partner can share expertise, provide mentorship, and offer real-world experience to youth that can help them achieve academically or prepare them to start a career.
* Partners can help youth learn more about areas of interest and even new career options related to those areas.
* By providing access to materials, equipment, or expertise that the library lacks, partners can expose youth to new creative experiences.
* Partners can give teens a chance to contribute to an effort bigger than the kinds of projects that are usually available to them. 
* Community groups can help bring new audiences to library programs, making new peer connections possible. 
* Adults, mentors, and peer experts show teens that their goals are valid and important through mentoring or providing other support
* Community mapping can reveal assets to add to the network of resources you help teens connect to.
* Community mapping can tell you what opportunities teens would like to have and help you find support for those opportunities and others.
* Engaging the entire community in the development of teens develops a sense of shared purpose and lets the teens know they are valued.
