Now that you’ve read through the information on community-centered library services it’s time to get started trying it for yourself.  Use the [Community-Centered Services workbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13FyfJr_D6-I2R6_OQhcj0SevTEdMySuy8lh_tLoUl0w/edit#){:target="_blank"} to keep on track.

## [#1: Community-Centered Services K-W-L](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13FyfJr_D6-I2R6_OQhcj0SevTEdMySuy8lh_tLoUl0w/edit#heading=h.5pf3n53wqrjk){:target="_blank"}

Complete this worksheet by first describing your experience (if any) with community-centered services. Then create a list of what you already know (the K in KWL) about community-centered services. In the second column, write down what you want (W) to learn in this module. You’ll fill out the last column, what you learned (L), when you have completed this module.

## [#2: Who Are Your Partners?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13FyfJr_D6-I2R6_OQhcj0SevTEdMySuy8lh_tLoUl0w/edit#heading=h.4hwqn6no1hlk){:target="_blank"}
Take a few minutes and write down all of the stakeholders and organizations you have a partnership with in support of teen services. Add more rows to the table if you need to.

After coming up with your list, write down the ways in which that partnership is demonstrated. For example, what do you partner on, how is the partnership setup, why do you define what you are thinking about as a partnership?

Now ask yourself, is the partnership successful? Why? Why not?

As you read the module, consider your answers and how your partnership work does and doesn’t fit in with the ideas presented.

## [#3: What are your questions?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13FyfJr_D6-I2R6_OQhcj0SevTEdMySuy8lh_tLoUl0w/edit#heading=h.pvvbazhwa6dh){:target="_blank"}
Brainstorm some questions you have about your community. Try to generate as many questions as possible at this stage — you’ll choose a few to focus on next. Some sample questions are provided to help you get started. 

## [#4: Who can help you?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13FyfJr_D6-I2R6_OQhcj0SevTEdMySuy8lh_tLoUl0w/edit#heading=h.lbuwh44xric6){:target="_blank"}
Consider what and who you already know which can help you to get to the answers you are looking for?  Is there a friend, family member or colleague who can help you? Do you think a friend of a friend would be good to connect with? Where else might you look for background information? Or, are you starting from scratch? Select one of the questions you brainstormed in the previous worksheet, and write down people or other resources that you can use to start to find out the answers. 

## [#5: How will you get your answers?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13FyfJr_D6-I2R6_OQhcj0SevTEdMySuy8lh_tLoUl0w/edit#heading=h.yfplr2ze91z0){:target="_blank"}
Write down what you think are the best ways to get answers from the question you described on the previous worksheet. Will you review numerical data, participate in asset mapping, have conversations with community members and stakeholders, all of these, or a couple of these?


## [#6: Analyzing the data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13FyfJr_D6-I2R6_OQhcj0SevTEdMySuy8lh_tLoUl0w/edit#heading=h.padjn2a0668g){:target="_blank"}
For each information-gathering activity you completed, write down your key findings in a few sentences. Then synthesize the results in a paragraph summarizing what you have learned about your community, and answer the following questions to help you figure out your next steps.
