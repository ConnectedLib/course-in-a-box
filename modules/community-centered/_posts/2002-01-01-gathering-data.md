When having conversations with community stakeholders, you are on the road to gathering data about the community in support of teens and connected learning.  There are several different ways you can continuously connect data about your community. The following provides techniques to use to get started.

## What questions do you want to have answered?

As you start to learn about your community a good thing to do is to make a list of questions you have about the community and/or teens.  You might want to know what teens do in their spare time?  Or, you might wonder about the racial and ethnic makeup of teens and their families in the area.  Perhaps you are wondering what others in the community think are challenges for teens? Or, what do others have to say about the ways in which teens are helping the community?  When you have a short list of questions, youâ€™ll be able to start thinking about the type of data that will help you to answer those questions.  As you read each of the  potential techniques to use for community-centered data gathering, refer back to your list of questions and consider how that technique could help you to uncover the answers. As you gather answers, consider what new questions you have and how you might have those answered.  As a community-centered library, asking questions about the community and seeking out answers should be an ongoing process, not something you do once.
