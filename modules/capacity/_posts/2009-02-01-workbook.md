### [Worksheet #1: Capacity K-W-L](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14FRMg54QQpWBZymkAtbECpGbtRVI5dwk5CGuuUiXASc/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}

Before moving forward in the module, spend some time thinking about what you already know about connected learning, and what you hope to learn from this module. The [first worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14FRMg54QQpWBZymkAtbECpGbtRVI5dwk5CGuuUiXASc/edit#heading=h.5pf3n53wqrjk){:target="_blank"} in your [_Capacity_ Workbook_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14FRMg54QQpWBZymkAtbECpGbtRVI5dwk5CGuuUiXASc/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} is a "KWL" — that stands for Know, Want to learn, and Learned. 

First describe your experience (if any) with capacity. Then make a list of things you already **know** about capacity. Then write down what you **want to learn** in this module. You’ll fill out the last column, what you learned (L), when you have completed this module.

### [Worksheet #2: Start mapping your capacity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14FRMg54QQpWBZymkAtbECpGbtRVI5dwk5CGuuUiXASc/edit#heading=h.4hwqn6no1hlk){:target="_blank"}

Now it’s your turn. Start mapping your library’s capacity in the areas of staffing, space, material resources, and partnerships.
