If your library faces capacity challenges, know that you are not alone. Most public libraries face challenges in some aspect of capacity, whether it’s space, material resources, staffing, or partnerships. Our goal in this section is to make troubleshooting capacity challenges at your library accessible, so you can feel confident in your library’s capacity to provide connected learning infused programs.

## Small spaces
Libraries often have difficulty providing enough space for library programs. How can you troubleshoot space capacity in a small library?

* Make use of community partnerships that have large meeting spaces. Determine which library programs or outreach programs can be done outside of the library.
* Keep things mobile. Make use of furniture with wheels that can be reconfigured to suit a variety of uses.
* Have smaller programs more often. If a certain library program is so popular you don’t have the space to host it, consider presenting the same program on multiple days and limiting the number of participants.

## Small budgets

It can be difficult to afford enough resources — whether that’s collections, technology, or program supplies — to do everything you want to do. How can you troubleshoot resource acquisition with a small budget?

* Make use of community partnerships. Is there a community organization that would be willing to donate new technology to your library, or lend it for special events? 
* Partner-organized book drives, donations, and fundraisers can all help your library acquire new resources.
* Keep currently owned technology running and up to date. 
* Train staff to evaluate your current technology and provide computers and tablets with the latest updates.
* Consider smaller program sizes. One way to run programs with limited access to technology is to have patrons pre-register for the program--but make sure to consider who might not be included in this if they don’t have an easy way to access the registration form.
* Get community feedback on new materials. What resources are the most important to your community, in their own words?
* Make sure what you already have is accessible. Are people able to access and use the resources you already have?

## Small volunteer pool

Libraries with few volunteers might have trouble keeping up with the demands on their staff and might not be able to focus on staffing new programs in their libraries. How can these libraries troubleshoot ways to increase their volunteer population?

* Talking to your community partners is the first step in growing your volunteer population.
* Recruit through outreach. Schools, retirement homes, and even grocery stores are great places to visit, or place flyers, to get the word out that your library is looking for volunteers.
* Provide volunteer rewards. Rewards can be something as simple as a special library tote bag or pin, and can also include awards like “Volunteer of the Month.”
* Teens who volunteer can be more than just extra hands — make sure their volunteering is a connected learning experience that will help them build community connections and prepare for future opportunities. This will make their volunteer impact more powerful for the library as well!
