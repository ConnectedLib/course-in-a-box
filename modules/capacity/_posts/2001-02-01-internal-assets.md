title: Internal Asset Mapping 
tags: ['sectionHead']
---

Library staff sometimes feel like they don’t have the capacity to build connected learning services. They feel like capacity for this work is lacking because they are committed to many services already and don’t see ways to extend or re-think their capacity within the constraints of what is already in place. One way to re-imagine capacity in support of connected learning services is through internal asset mapping. 

You may have already created a community asset map while working through the [Community-Centered Services module](../../community-centered/). Internal asset mapping is a similar activity: you look inward at library resources and consider the assets that the library already brings to its work with and for the community. This process enables you to: 

* Consider library staff strengths in context of the needs of youth served
* Dismantle silos within the organization so those working in different areas can join forces to build capacity in support of youth and families and connected learning
* Consider relationships between you and other staff members
* Leverage community interests determine organizational priorities
* Provide a better language for the organization to serve the local connected learning ecosystem and the entire community

## Fictional Case Studies

To explore how this process works, let’s look at three different fictional libraries: a large urban library, a midsized suburban library, and a small rural library.

### Large, Urban Library: Gotham Public Library

Gotham Public Library is a large system with 17 branches scattered across the densely populated city of Gotham. The central branch serves a population of [???] and has a number of sizable meeting spaces. Despite this seeming wealth of resources, there has been much more focus on adult and children’s services and programming, with teen services falling through the cracks. Teen Services has a relationship with most of the local high schools, but has not leveraged many other community partnerships.

### Midsize, Suburban Library: Sunnydale Public Library

Sunnydale Public Library is located in a sprawling suburban area. It is a midsize library, and serves a population of about 16,000. It has a meeting room for library programs, and two study rooms. As well as having open seating areas for reading and studying, the library uses roughly half of its open space to make room for 38 computers. They have knowledgeable staff and strong community partnerships. Many of these community partnerships help to fund new technology acquisitions, since the library’s tech budget is split across the system to which it belongs. The library employs two adult services librarians, a children’s librarian, and a teen librarian. Also on staff are five library associates and a base of twenty rotating volunteers.

### Small, Rural Library: Smallville Public Library

Smallville is a rural town located between two larger cities, both over an hour’s drive away with no public transportation options. The library serves a population of about [???], most of whom are employed in agriculture or a local factory. There is one full-time librarian, and two part-time staff. One of the part-time staff members is the designated “children’s librarian” which covers infancy through high school. Everyone in town knows the library, but not many official partnerships have been established. Most of the library collection is contained in a single room, with a corner dedicated to the children’s section with low tables and chairs. There are some tables and seating in the area where the two public access computers are located.

Now it’s your turn. Start mapping your library’s capacity in the areas of staffing, space, material resources, and partnerships.
