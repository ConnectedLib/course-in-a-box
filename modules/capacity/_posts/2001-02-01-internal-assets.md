title: Internal Asset Mapping 
tags: ['sectionHead']
---

Library staff sometimes feel like they don’t have the capacity to build connected learning services. They feel like capacity for this work is lacking because they are committed to many services already and don’t see ways to extend or re-think their capacity within the constraints of what is already in place. One way to re-imagine capacity in support of connected learning services is through internal asset mapping. 

You may have already created a community asset map while working through the [Community-Centered Services module](../../community-centered/). Internal asset mapping is a similar activity: you look inward at library resources and consider the assets that the library already brings to its work with and for the community. This process enables you to: 

- Consider library staff strengths in context of the needs of youth served
- Dismantle silos within the organization so those working in different areas can join forces to build capacity in support of youth and families and connected learning
- Consider relationships between you and other staff members
- Leverage community interests determine organizational priorities
- Provide a better language for the organization to serve the local connected learning ecosystem and the entire community

## Staff

Staffing capacity refers not only to the number of staff members your library has, but also to your staff’s strengths and unique abilities. For example, how many staff work with you? Does your library have staff dedicated to or knowledgable about specific technologies? Staff availability is also important. For instance, if you have one teen librarian on staff who is in charge of the reference desk for a certain number of hours a day in addition to their other duties, they may have less capacity for teen programming.

For any size library, looking at different sets of human resources — such as departments or teams — can provide a helpful overview. It can also be helpful to focus in on the key people who work in or with youth services.

## Space

Even staff at the largest library may find that they often do not have the physical capacity to implement all of the programs and activities that they would like. While space can be a challenge, the capacity of your library can be augmented using community strengths and partnerships. The first step is gaining in-depth knowledge of your library’s space.
There are a variety of ways to assess the space capacity of your library. While the most common is to think of your spaces by their square footage, or by their max occupancy numbers, there are other factors that are often not thought about. Ask yourself the following questions as you evaluate your library's spaces: 
* Can the shelving in that space be moved easily? 
* Are the tables on wheels, or otherwise easily mobile? 
* Can the chairs stack?
* Can you configure the space for an everyday "hang out" area? How about a workshop with groups at different tables, or different computer workstations? What about meeting layout -- a speaker and audience, or a more intimate circle configuration? 
* Is this space equally accessible to everyone?
## Resources
Resources are any physical or digital goods that you can use for youth services: art supplies, furniture, animals, puzzles, computers, software, machinery, snacks – the list can go on! The material resources capacity of your library can be thought of in two parts: 

Acquisition: refers to your library’s unique capacity to acquire resources. This includes your library’s technology and programming budget, as well as the sources your library uses to acquire materials. For example, if you had a community partnership with a robotics club, they might be able to help supply you with motors, and a friendly movie theater might provide popcorn on special occasions. Both your budget and your library’s unique partnerships play roles in your resource acquisition.

Use: refers to your library’s use of these resources, and your staff members’ abilities to use and teach the use of them. What is your library’s capacity in relation to technology use? Does anyone know how to use that sewing machine? 
 
## Relationships
Partnerships are an important aspect for the capacity of your individual library. As mentioned in our [Community Centered Services module](), partnerships can be formal ones with specific organizations, or informal ones with members of your community. For instance, a library might formally partner with the local Boys and Girls club for specific services for youth after school, or informally partner with a local artist by asking them to take part in a youth services program.
