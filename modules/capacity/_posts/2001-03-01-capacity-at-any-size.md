<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/capacity/big_city_med.png"  ALT="Big City"/>
 
Gotham Public Library is a large system with 17 branches scattered across the densely populated city of Gotham. The central branch serves a population of several hundred thousand and has a number of sizable meeting spaces. Despite this seeming wealth of resources, there has been much more focus on adult and children’s services and programming, with teen services falling through the cracks. Teen Services has a relationship with most of the local high schools, but has not leveraged many other community partnerships.

### Small, Rural Library: Smallville Library

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/capacity/rural_med.png"  ALT="Rural area"/>
 
Smallville is a rural town located between two larger cities, both over an hour’s drive away with no public transportation options. The library serves a population of about 1500, most of whom are employed in agriculture. The director, who grew up in Smallville, is the only full-time staff member, and there are a few community volunteers. No one involved with the library has a library degree. The library is open 22 hours each week. The director is responsible for all services and calls in volunteers to help facilitate story times, book discussion groups, and other activities. Everyone in town knows the library, but not many official partnerships have been established. Most of the library collection is contained in a single room, with a corner dedicated to the children’s section with low tables and chairs. There are some tables and seating in the area where the two public access computers are located.
