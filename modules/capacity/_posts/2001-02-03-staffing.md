title: Staff 
---


Staffing capacity refers not only to the number of staff members your library has, but also to your staffâ€™s strengths and unique abilities. For example, how many youth librarians do you have on staff? Does your library have staff dedicated to or knowledgable about specific technologies? Staff availability is also important. For instance, if you have one teen librarian on staff who is in charge of the reference desk for a certain number of hours a day in addition to their other duties, they may have less capacity for teen programming.

If your library is not extremely small, you can begin by looking at staffing at a macro level, as shown in the following examples.

	    Knowledgeable about connected learning</td>
	<td>Can't keep up with every topic teens are interested in</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>IT staff</td>
	<td>Have training programs for all library software</td>
	<td>Programs focus exclusively on software features and how-tos, not the creative process or connecting to other areas of life</td>

	<td>Children's Services</td>
	<td>Have established relationships with library visitors who are aging up into the teen programs</td>
	<td>Are occupied with children's programming</td>
</tr>

If your library is on the smaller side, or if you want to focus in on the key people who work in or with youth services, take a more micro approach. 

<div class="colorhighlight color3" markdown="1">


### Smallville Library 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/capacity/1_person_med.png"  ALT="One person"/>


<table class="worksheet">

	<th>Passions and interests</th>
	<th>Relationships with other staff</th>
	<th>Relationships with community</th>
	<th>Organizational priorities</th>
	<th>Values, goals, etc.</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
