title: Staff 
---


Staffing capacity refers not only to the number of staff members your library has, but also to your staffâ€™s strengths and unique abilities. For example, how many youth librarians do you have on staff? Does your library have staff dedicated to or knowledgable about specific technologies? Staff availability is also important. For instance, if you have one teen librarian on staff who is in charge of the reference desk for a certain number of hours a day in addition to their other duties, they may have less capacity for teen programming.

If your library is not extremely small, you can begin by looking at staffing at a macro level, as shown in the following examples.

If your library is on the smaller side, or if you want to focus in on the key people who work in or with youth services, take a more micro approach.
