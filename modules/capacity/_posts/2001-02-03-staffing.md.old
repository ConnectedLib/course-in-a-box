title: Staff 
---


Staffing capacity refers not only to the number of staff members your library has, but also to your staff’s strengths and unique abilities. For example, how many staff work with you? Does your library have staff dedicated to or knowledgable about specific technologies? Staff availability is also important. For instance, if you have one teen librarian on staff who is in charge of the reference desk for a certain number of hours a day in addition to their other duties, they may have less capacity for teen programming.

For any size library, looking at different sets of human resources — such as departments or teams — can provide a helpful overview. It can also be helpful to to focus in on the key people who work in or with youth services. Review these examples of both approaches as they might look for our three fictional libraries.

If your library is on the smaller side, or if you want to focus in on the key people who work in or with youth services, take a more micro approach.
