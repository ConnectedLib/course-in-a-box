Partnerships are an important aspect for the capacity of your individual library. As mentioned in our [Community Partnerships module](), partnerships can be formal ones with specific organizations, or informal ones with members of your community. For instance, a library might formally partner with the local Boys and Girls club for specific services for youth after school, or informally partner with a local artist by asking them to take part in a youth services program.
