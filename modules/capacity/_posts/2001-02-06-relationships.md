Partnerships are an important aspect for the capacity of your individual library. As mentioned in our [Community Partnerships module](), partnerships can be formal ones with specific organizations, or informal ones with members of your community. For instance, a library might formally partner with the local Boys and Girls club for specific services for youth after school, or informally partner with a local artist by asking them to take part in a youth services program.

Once you have completed your internal asset map review the full document and consider the following:

* In what ways can the information on the internal asset map help you to connect with one or more colleagues in order to support connected learning services?
* How can you leverage existing relationships and passions and interests of colleagues in support of connected learning services?
* Who would you like to talk more with to learn about what they do and how their work can help you understand the community better, build relationships, and serve youth and families?
* What do you notice about the internal assets on your “map” that you never thought about?
