title: Material Resources 
---

Material resources are any physical or digital goods that you can use for youth services: art supplies, furniture, animals, puzzles, computers, software, machinery, snacks – the list can go on! The material resources capacity of your library can be thought of in two parts: 
Acquisition: refers to your library’s unique capacity to acquire resources. This includes your library’s technology and programming budget, as well as the sources your library uses to acquire materials. For example, if you had a community partnership with a robotics club, they might be able to help supply you with motors, and a friendly movie theater might provide popcorn on special occasions. Both your budget and your library’s unique partnerships play roles in your resource acquisition.
Use: refers to your library’s use of these resources, and your staff members’ abilities to use and teach the use of them. What is your library’s capacity in relation to technology use? Does anyone know how to use that sewing machine?
