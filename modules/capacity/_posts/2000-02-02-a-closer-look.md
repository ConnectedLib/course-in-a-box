title: Taking a closer look 
---
You can gain further insight into your library’s capacity and potential by looking at each element in more detail: staffing, partnerships, material resources, and space. 

## Staffing
Staffing capacity refers not only to the number of staff members your library has, but also to your staff’s strengths and unique abilities. For example, how many youth librarians do you have on staff? Does your library have staff dedicated to or knowledgable about specific technologies? Staff availability is also important. For instance, if you have one teen librarian on staff who is in charge of the reference desk for a certain number of hours a day in addition to their other duties, they may have less capacity for teen programming.

If your library is not extremely small, you can begin by looking at staffing at a macro level, as shown in the following examples.

If your library is on the smaller side, or if you want to focus in on the key people who work in or with youth services, take a more micro approach.

## Space
Even large libraries may find that they often do not have the physical capacity to implement all of the programs and activities that they would like. While space can be a challenge, the capacity of your library can be augmented using community strengths and partnerships. The first step is gaining in-depth knowledge of your library’s space.
There are a variety of ways to assess the space capacity of your library. While the most common is to think of your spaces by their square footage, or by their max occupancy numbers, there are other factors that are often not thought about. Do you have bookshelves that can be moved easily in that space? Are the tables on wheels, or otherwise easily mobile? Can the chairs in an area stack?
Here is a quick and easy checklist you can follow when evaluating your library’s spaces:
What is the square footage?
Is the furniture (bookshelves, tables, chairs) easily mobile or stackable?
How many different configurations can the room be organized in? Is one of those configurations more space efficient?
Is this space accessible to everyone?

## Material Resources
Material resources are any physical or digital goods that you can use for youth services: art supplies, furniture, animals, puzzles, computers, software, machinery, snacks – the list can go on! The material resources capacity of your library can be thought of in two parts: 
Acquisition: refers to your library’s unique capacity to acquire resources. This includes your library’s technology and programming budget, as well as the sources your library uses to acquire materials. For example, if you had a community partnership with a robotics club, they might be able to help supply you with motors, and a friendly movie theater might provide popcorn on special occasions. Both your budget and your library’s unique partnerships play roles in your resource acquisition.
Use: refers to your library’s use of these resources, and your staff members’ abilities to use and teach the use of them. What is your library’s capacity in relation to technology use? Does anyone know how to use that sewing machine?

## Relationships
Partnerships are an important aspect for the capacity of your individual library. As mentioned in our [Community Partnerships module](), partnerships can be formal ones with specific organizations, or informal ones with members of your community. For instance, a library might formally partner with the local Boys and Girls club for specific services for youth after school, or informally partner with a local artist by asking them to take part in a youth services program.

Once you have completed your internal asset map review the full document and consider the following:

* In what ways can the information on the internal asset map help you to connect with one or more colleagues in order to support connected learning services?
* How can you leverage existing relationships and passions and interests of colleagues in support of connected learning services?
* Who would you like to talk more with to learn about what they do and how their work can help you understand the community better, build relationships, and serve youth and families?
* What do you notice about the internal assets on your “map” that you never thought about?
