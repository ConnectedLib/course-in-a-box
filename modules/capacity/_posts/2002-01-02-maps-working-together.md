title: Make your maps work together
---

~ under construction ~

Let’s take a moment to reflect on the community that your library serves. If you created a map for the Community Mapping module, have it ready to reference. Think about the people, places, services and businesses that make up your community that you are represented on this map. It can be helpful to visualize your Community Map in relation to their strengths and assets, and can be done in a very similar way to assessing the capacity of your library. As you are doing this, keep in mind which assets and strengths might be the most helpful in relation to your library’s capacity. 


Once you have an understanding of your library’s capacity in terms of strengths and weaknesses, as well as a comprehensive view of your community’s assets and needs, where do you go next? What do you do with this information? The next step of assessing your library’s capacity is to create a tool that will lead your future efforts. This tool will synthesize the capacity challenges of your library, and how these challenges can be addressed using strengths you or your community already possess.

You may have noticed that this map lists the needs of community members in relation to our Midsize library. We encourage you, in your own assessment, to list the needs of your community members that don’t necessarily relate to your library in addition to this list. These can include needs like: resources access for your homeless community, musical instruments for the high school band, and more. While ways to support your community in these needs might not be obvious at first, knowing that the needs exist can help your library to provide supplemental resources. For example, while your library cannot provide laundry machines for your homeless youth, it can provide pamphlets with maps marking where safe facilities like that are freely available.

Once you have an understanding of your library’s capacity in terms of strengths and weaknesses, as well as a comprehensive view of your community’s assets and needs, where do you go next? What do you do with this information? The next step of assessing your library’s capacity is to create a tool that will lead your future efforts. This tool will synthesize the capacity challenges of your library, and how these challenges can be addressed using strengths you or your community already possess.
