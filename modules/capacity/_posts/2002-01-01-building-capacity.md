## Library Systems and Structures in Support of Capacity

As mentioned previously, often library staff struggle with capacity building because of the services, policies, and procedures that are in place and that can hinder their ability to move connected learning services forward.  Some of the library systems and structures that may get in the way include:

* **Job descriptions**: For example, if a job description does not include language that requires you to build relationships with the community, it may be difficult to get buy-in for that activity from colleagues and administrators.
* **Staffing models:** If you are required to be on a reference or circulation desk for multiple hours during your work day, and that limits your ability to connect with internal or external assets, that can hinder building connected learning services.
* **Mindsets about library work:** Sometimes library staff think that time spent planning a service or time spent analyzing assessment and evaluation data is not how hours in the day should be spent.  
* **Policies and procedures:** There may be policies and procedures that your library has in place that unintentionally limit your ability to work with colleagues, community stakeholders, and/or youth and families in order to build capacity for connected learning services. For example, your libraryâ€™s hours may not coincide with the hours in which community stakeholders are available to talk with you about opportunities for building services together.  

None of these hindrances should derail you from moving forward with building capacity for connected learning services.  Some methods for advocating for changes in one or more of the above challenges include:

* Making it a regular practice to talk about the impact of connected learning services for youth and families in the community.  You may tell a story of a teen that benefited from a connected learning service that you facilitated, or you may ask a teen to tell their own story at a library board of trustees meeting or another venue where library staff and administrators are gathered together.
* Talking with administrators and colleagues about the ways in which working together can help the library better serve the community overall.  You may provide an example of how by moving beyond staffing and service silos in which staff members do not get the chance to learn from and with each other about the community and its needs and assets you reach a more diverse group of community members who through your internally collaborative services will have the chance to grow and thrive.
* Describing how changes in job descriptions and policies can help the library overall be better centered on community.  Provide a sample job description for yourself that highlights what your work might look like and through that work your ability to build library capacity while at the same time building community strengths.
