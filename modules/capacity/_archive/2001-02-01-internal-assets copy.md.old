title: Internal Asset Mapping 
tags: ['sectionHead']
---
Library staff sometimes feel like they don’t have the capacity to build connected learning services. They feel like capacity for this work is lacking because they are committed to many services already and don’t see ways to extend or re-think their capacity within the constraints of what is already in place. One way to re-imagine capacity in support of connected learning services is through internal asset mapping. 
You may have already created a community asset map while working through the [Community-Centered Services module](../../community-centered/). Internal asset mapping is a similar activity: you look inward at library resources and consider the assets that the library already brings to its work with and for the community. This process enables you to: 
* Consider library staff strengths in context of the needs of youth served
* Dismantle silos within the organization so those working in different areas can join forces to build capacity in support of youth and families and connected learning
* Consider relationships between you and other staff members
* Leverage community interests determine organizational priorities
* Provide a better language for the organization to serve the local connected learning ecosystem and the entire community
To explore how this process works, let’s look at three different fictional libraries: a large urban library, a midsized suburban library, and a small rural library.

## Large, Urban Library: Gotham Public Library

Gotham Public Library is a large system with 17 branches scattered across the densely populated city of Gotham. The central branch serves a population of several hundred thousand and has a number of sizable meeting spaces. Despite this seeming wealth of resources, there has been much more focus on adult and children’s services and programming, with teen services falling through the cracks. Teen Services has a relationship with most of the local high schools, but has not leveraged many other community partnerships.

## Midsize, Suburban Library: Sunnydale Public Library

The Sunnydale Library is located in a sprawling suburban area. It is a midsize library with a main library and one branch.   The main branch has a meeting room for programs and meetings, two study rooms, and open seating areas across the building.  There are 38 computers in the main library in various areas of the building including in the children's area, the teen area, and in adult reading, studying, and browsing areas.  Staff is knowledgeable about the community and the library's services. Their community partnerships are strong and staff members are a part of committees and planning groups as well as work with partners to design services for the community.  One partner supports the library's technology needs through funding various technology purchases.   Staff includes two full-time adult services librarians, a full-time children's librarian, and a full time teen librarian.  Each department also has part-time support staff. There are also volunteers who work with the library staff on various projects.

## Small, Rural Library: Smallville Public Library

Smallville is a rural town located between two larger cities, both over an hour’s drive away with no public transportation options. The library serves a population of about 1500, most of whom are employed in agriculture. The director, who grew up in Smallville, is the only full-time staff member, and there are a few community volunteers. No one involved with the library has a library degree. The library is open 22 hours each week. The director is responsible for all services and calls in volunteers to help facilitate story times, book discussion groups, and other activities. Everyone in town knows the library, but not many official partnerships have been established. Most of the library collection is contained in a single room, with a corner dedicated to the children’s section with low tables and chairs. There are some tables and seating in the area where the two public access computers are located.

### [Worksheet #2: Start mapping your capacity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14FRMg54QQpWBZymkAtbECpGbtRVI5dwk5CGuuUiXASc/edit#heading=h.4hwqn6no1hlk){:target="_blank"}
 
Now it’s your turn. Start mapping your library’s capacity in the areas of staffing, space, material resources, and partnerships.

You can gain further insight into your library’s capacity and potential by looking at each element in more detail: staffing, space, material resources, and relationships.
