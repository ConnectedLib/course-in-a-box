title: Analyzing data

Once you have collected data, you must somehow transform it into evidence that you can use to answer your assessment questions. Quantitative data can undergo quantitative analysis, and qualitative data can be analyzed either **qualitatively** or **quantitatively**.

## Qualitative analysis

Given the variety of methods and goals for assessing a connected learning initiative, not to mention the variation in connected learning programs in general, the exact process you follow to analyze your qualitative data will also vary. However, you will probably be conducting a form of content analysis, which occurs in four main phases.


* Read through the data several times until you are thoroughly familiar with the content. 
* Perform a content analysis. This can be as simple as applying useful keywords or categories to each response, or, for more formal analysis, developing a "codebook" of descriptive labels (or "codes"). 
* Look for themes and patterns in the data you've categorized or coded. What codes show up the most? Are there codes that are usually found together? Do some participant groups use certain codes more than other groups? How can you synthesize this data into evidence for the answer to your assessment or evaluation question?

## Quantitative analysis

Quantitative analysis is the process of "analyzing data that's numbers-based."^1 _Descriptive_ analysis provides statistics that describe a group of people or items, like the average attendance of a library program or the median age of participants. Inferential statistics help you predict differences or relationships between groups, or make predictions about the real world based on a sample group.

## Quantitative analysis of qualitative data

It is often useful to use quantitative (number-based) analysis on qualitative data. For instance, you can count the number of teens who mentioned interest in a STEM career during their interviews, or what percentage of participants completed a challenge. Be careful not to misinterpret the numbers. For instance, a very talkative teen who gave a 10-minute interview might mention a STEM career more often than a quieter person who only talked for 3 minutes, but that doesnâ€™t necessarily mean the talkative person is more interested in STEM careers.
