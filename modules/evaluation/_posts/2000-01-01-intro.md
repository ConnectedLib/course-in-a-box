### [Worksheet #1: Assessment & Evaluation K-W-L](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YO8aWs59kALm48t1D30BvbMkGH0xOCn7xXLlUHAC4EY/edit#heading=h.5pf3n53wqrjk){:target="_blank"}


Before moving forward in the module, spend some time thinking about what you already know about assessment and evaluation, and what you hope to learn from this module. The [first worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14FRMg54QQpWBZymkAtbECpGbtRVI5dwk5CGuuUiXASc/edit#heading=h.5pf3n53wqrjk){:target="_blank"} in your [_Assessment & Evaluation Workbook_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14FRMg54QQpWBZymkAtbECpGbtRVI5dwk5CGuuUiXASc/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} is a "KWL" — that stands for Know, Want to learn, and Learned. 

Complete this worksheet by first describing your experience (if any) with assessment and evaluation. Then create a list of what you already know (the K in KWL) about assessment and evaluation — in the context of a library, or otherwise. In the second column, write down what you want (W) to learn in this module. You’ll fill out the last column, what you learned (L), when you have completed this module.
