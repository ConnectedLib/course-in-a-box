<h1>About ConnectedLib</h1>

<h2>Our Current Work</h2>

<p>Our current work brings together interdisciplinary faculty and research scientists from the University of Washington (UW) Information School and the University of Maryland (UMD) College of Information Studies; advisory board members (AB) that are experts in connected learning (CL), continuing education, and rural and small public libraries; and partners that have reputable standing in terms of reaching rural and small libraries nationwide. The main goal of this project is to provide continuing education opportunities to library staff in rural and small libraries on how to embed CL principles into teen programs and services. We are scaling the ConnectedLib Toolkit by tailoring the content to meet the needs of rural and small library staff to serve their community’s teens successfully, as well as launching a community of practice (CoP) and learning circles that will empower these staff to support each other in building capacity and skills to implement CL activities. In addition, we are working with participating library staff to develop a new module for the Toolkit that focuses on youth civic engagement. This module is inspired by the recognition that many rural and small libraries serve as hubs of civic participation in their communities and are therefore well positioned to promote the civic engagement of their teen patrons.</p>

<p>We are partnering with two organizations: YALSA and the Association for Rural and Small Libraries (ARSL). YALSA was an instrumental partner in the grant that the ConnectedLib team previously received, specifically in the design, development, and deployment of the ConnectedLib Toolkit nationwide. The project will fill a significant need to produce worked examples of the application of CL in rural and small libraries, which is almost non-existent. It also fills a need to equip rural and small library staff with skills to design, develop, implement, and evaluate CL to serve teens in underserved areas that need such programming.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://clrn.dmlhub.net/publications/connected-learning-an-agenda-for-research-and-design" target="_blank">connected learning model</a> articulated by Mimi Ito and colleagues describes how networked technologies can be leveraged in a variety of settings — including libraries — to promote learning experiences that are interest-driven, peer-supported, academically-oriented, and connected to the various contexts that young people experience in their everyday lives. ConnectedLib responds directly to this need by working with in-service librarians to create a suite of professional development resources aimed at building librarians’ capacity to engage and promote connected learning and future-ready skills among today’s youth.</p>

## The Original ConnectedLib Project

With funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the ConnectedLib toolkit was created to help librarians promote connections across youth learning contexts. Faculty members from the library and information science (LIS) schools at the University of Washington (Dr. Katie Davis) and University of Maryland (Dr. Mega Subramaniam) teamed with public libraries to create professional development resources to support librarians in their efforts to leverage new media technologies and promote youth’s connected learning experiences in libraries. The public library partners who helped develop the toolkit — <a href="http://www.provlib.org/" target="_blank">Providence Public Library</a>, <a href="http://www.spl.org/" target="_blank">Seattle Public Library</a>, and <a href="http://www.krl.org/" target="_blank">Kitsap Regional Library</a> — serve a variety of traditionally underserved youth populations, including rural, immigrant, and low-income youth.
